## 1. Executive Summary


## 2. Purpose of the Project



## 3. Literature Review


- Graphene supply chain involves several stages:
    - Graphene production
    - Electrode fabrication
    - Battery assembly

Who are the suppliers of graphene?

What is the current market value of graphene production?

Is graphene used in lithium ion battery production? What is the ecpected growth/decline?
- That is the core of the project

Where can I find relevat dataset?
- What kind of dataset(s) would be relevant and beneficial for this project?
