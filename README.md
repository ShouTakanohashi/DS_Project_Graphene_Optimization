2. Types of graphene


Graphene (monolayer, defect-free)
Crumpled graphene (monoaxially- and biaxially-crumpled)
Graphene oxide (GO)
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
Thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO)
Electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO)
Chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO)
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs)
Hydrofluorinated graphene
Plasma hydrogenated graphene
Epitaxial graphene (grown on SiC)
Graphene mesh (GM)
Graphene foam
Graphene nanosheets
Graphene films (CVD-grown, exfoliated)
Graphene composites



Methods to procure graphene:
    - Top-down approach:
Mechanical exfoliation (sticky tape method)
Electrochemical exfoliation
Liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) using sonication and solvents
Laser ablation technique
Chemical exfoliation (e.g., oxidation and reduction of graphite oxide)
Hydrothermal synthesis
Microwave-assisted synthesis

    - Bottom-up approach:
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal substrates (copper, nickel, cobalt, iron)
Arc discharge method
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
Pyrolysis (thermal decomposition, e.g., of silicon carbide)

3. Global market


- Graphene supply chain involves several stages:
    - Graphene production
    - Electrode fabrication
    - Battery assembly

Who are the suppliers of graphene?

What is the current market value of graphene production?

Is graphene used in lithium ion battery production? What is the ecpected growth/decline?
- That is the core of the project

Where can I find relevat dataset?
- What kind of dataset(s) would be relevant and beneficial for this project?

There are challenges in scaling up the graphene production.
- Technological
- Cost

Data collection:
- difficult to do data collection and validation on global market value of graphene
- may need to narrow down the scope to company-level analysis



| Company | Year Founded | Headquarters | Produciton Start | Production Method |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| NanoXplore | 2011 | Montreal, Canada | Shortly after 2011 | (To be added soon) |

## 4. Setting Up the Environment


## 5. Phases After Setting Up the Envnronment

- Collect and compile robust datasets
    - Since the data on global market value is fragmented, we first need to find relevant sources, aggregate, and compile them for robust dataset.
    - To do so, we extract data from the following:
        - free summaries of reports from market reports, including from Precedence Research, Marketsandmarkets, Grand View Research.
            - We focus on the market size, CAGR, price ranges, and produciton volume predicitons.
        - Academic reviews
            - Papers and publicaitons, such as from Carbon, 2d Materials, 
        - Industry Sources
            - Website of suppliers, including NanoXplore and Graphenea, for production capacity and pricing.
            - Sources including Graphene Flagship
            - News articles on graphene production breakthroughs (i.e., flash joule heating). 

- Time series analysis
- etc

## 6. Findings



## 7. Limitaions


1. Challenges encountered:
    - Project began with the scope on global market value analysis. However, there were significant obstacles:
        - It is incredibly difficult to collect data due to:
            - fragmented nature of the data
            - difficulty accessing the data
            - drastically differing numbers, coming from differences in methodologies used in sources
        - Thus, it is also difficult to validate the data and ensure data consistency
    - We pivoted to company-level analysis to ensure transparency, consistency, accessibility and relevance of data.
