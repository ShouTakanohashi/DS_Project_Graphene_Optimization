## 1. Executive Summary

In Progress.

## 2. Purpose of the Project

Aiming to analyze the market value of graphene.
Aiming to focus on suppliers of graphene
- Growth of graphene production quantity
- Price prediction of produced graphene.

Review the quantity and price of graphene as of 2025.

Review the methods to produce graphene as of 2025.

Review the major suppliers of graphene (companies) as of 2025.

Review what kind of graphene is/are applicable for EV batteries.

Review the graphene quality requirement for EV batteries production (if any).

Review how the use of graphene instead of graphite improve performance of battery (if any).

Review the factors that inhibit large-scale production of graphene.


Quantify the target goal for how much graphene should be produced for large scale commercial application in EV batteries by 2030 (or 2035 0r 2040).

Quantify how much investments and subsidiary should be made on graphene suppliers to enable large scale commercial applications by 2030 (or 2035 or 2040).


## 3. Literature Review


- Graphene supply chain involves several stages:
    - Graphene production
    - Electrode fabrication
    - Battery assembly

Who are the suppliers of graphene?

What is the current market value of graphene production?

Is graphene used in lithium ion battery production? What is the ecpected growth/decline?
- That is the core of the project

Where can I find relevat dataset?
- What kind of dataset(s) would be relevant and beneficial for this project?

There are challenges in scaling up the graphene production.
- Technological
- Cost
