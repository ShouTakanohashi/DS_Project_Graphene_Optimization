## 1. Executive Summary

In Progress.

## 2. Purpose of the Project

Aiming to analyze the market value of graphene.
Aiming to focus on suppliers of graphene
- Growth of graphene production quantity
- Price prediction of produced graphene.

## 3. Literature Review


- Graphene supply chain involves several stages:
    - Graphene production
    - Electrode fabrication
    - Battery assembly

Who are the suppliers of graphene?

What is the current market value of graphene production?

Is graphene used in lithium ion battery production? What is the ecpected growth/decline?
- That is the core of the project

Where can I find relevat dataset?
- What kind of dataset(s) would be relevant and beneficial for this project?

There are challenges in scaling up the graphene production.
- Technological
- Cost
